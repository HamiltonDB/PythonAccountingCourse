# Introduction
This course is primarily focused on setting up students to use python for accounting purposes

For this reason we will be using JupyterLab (or JupyterNotebook) and our learning will be very focused. However,
we will have to begin with the python basics.

I have provided some resources here that I found to be high quality for a variety of topics you will need when first starting

Keep in mind some things will be very confusing in the beginning for those not familiar with programming but I assure you that as you
move forwards and learn, more things will fall into place.

For learning, this class is pretty much just a list of assignments. The goal of this is to have students self-study with the below resources
to complete these assignments. The assignments are also specifically targeted to force learning the necessary skills to complete the units.

## Installing JupyterLab
Before installing, there are some options that don't require install mentioned in the video provided in [Introduction to JupyterLab](#introduction-to-jupyterlab)

First to install you will need to figure out whether you have Windows, Linux, or Mac

These are software that your computer runs that you can think of as the core of your computer. It will be important
to know which of these is on your computer as the process for using and installing JupyterLab is slightly different on each. 

Below I have provided an explanation of how to check for each one and a link to an installation guide for JupyterLab for each one:
- Windows: Developed by Microsoft. If you see a Windows logo (four blue squares) on your computer or a Start button in the lower left corner of your screen, you're using Windows. Most PCs (non-Apple computers) come with Windows.
  - For windows please follow the below guide
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ47rIO5bTw
- Mac: Developed by Apple. If you have an Apple computer (MacBook, iMac, etc.), you're using macOS. You'll see an Apple logo at the top of your screen and a dock with app icons usually at the bottom.
  - If you have Mac, you already will have python3 installed. You can skip to the JupyterLab introduction video (which shows how to install it on linux since the instructions are nearly the same)
  - You will just want to run `python3 -m pip install jupyterlab` and then to start it run `python3 -m jupyter lab`
- Linux: This is less common for everyday users. If someone else set up your computer and told you it runs Linux, or if you see terms like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Mint, you're using Linux.
  - For Linux the same instructions as Mac apply
 
## Introduction to JupyterLab
The video below does a good job of explaining JupyterLabs. The big advantage of JupyterLab/JupyterNotebook is that it makes documenting your code easy and it makes your code quick to run in small pieces

This makes it really good for data science where you do some operation to your data and then need to do another operation to your data.

If this doesn't make sense yet, you will see what I mean as you use it and as you watch the video below!

I think another important note is that this video mentions [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) which both allow you to use JupyterLabs without installing anything
or paying. Feel free to use these as much as you like. I personally prefer the local option but there is nothing wrong with using these.

## Python Basics Resources
The best resource I found online that was recommended was this course in Python from a University in Helsinki (in English still)

[Python MOOC Helsinki](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/part-1)

As another resource, however, the official Python documentation is actually quite excellent even for beginners.
It is slightly less friendly than the class above but I recommend using it for examples and to supplement the above course.

[Python Official Documentation Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

# Course Topics
This courses ultimate goal is to teach the very basics of NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Web Requests

To reach this however we will need to start off with the basics

## Python Fundamentals
  - Basic syntax and data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans) 
  - Variables and assignment 
  - Simple arithmetic operations (essential for accounting calculations) 
  - Conditionals (if/else statements) 
  - Functions (defining, parameters, return values) 
  - Lists and dictionaries (foundational data structures) 
  - Loops (for and while) 
  - String formatting
  - Basic file I/O (reading/writing files) 
  - Simple error handling (try/except) 

# Assignments
This course will primarily just be assignments. Before you start I would follow along with these classes a little bit and then look at the assignments. 
The first few just require arithmetic, functions, variables and assignment, basic syntax and data types, and conditionals.

Then loops and strings are the next topics.

If you see something in the assignment that you don't know how to do, find those topics in the listed resources above or in external resources (there's a ton of good python resources around) and
learn them before continuing with the assignment.

A lot of the early assignments are similar so if you read it and think it would be easy feel free to skip. I also have not fully defined all the assignments yet so more are to come.

Here is the current list:
- 1-Calculate-Rectangle-Area
- 2-Convert-Temperature
- 3-Check-Number-Category
- 4-Calculate-Shipping-Cost
- 5-Create-User-Greeting
- 6-Format-Phone-Number
- 7-Sum-Numbers
- 8-Count-Words
- 9-Filter-Strings-by-Length
- 10-Contact-Manager

To start these assignments, you can download them by clicking on the green `<> Code` button at the top right, and then click `Download ZIP`

When it finishes downloading on windows you can simply right-click and then click `Extract All...`

It will then prompt you with a path, the current path will be where the `ZIP` is currently at, this is OK and you can click `Extract`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d43d934a-d137-4814-a4b2-2741757c63ac)

There will be the `README.md` inside this folder and the `assignments/` directory

All the assignments are inside the `assignments/` directory and this folder can be opened in JupyterLab through the sidebar as pictured below
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/711e8eb5-da9b-4368-aee0-6dc967435ed5)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42e5a888-3713-4088-9192-31071a8bf8cf)

Finally after navigating down to assignments you should double left-click on the assignment you want to do
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b846514a-c6f6-4024-8e71-5a86ae1a4cb5)


You can also download a single assignment or file on github by going to the file and clicking the download button I have noted in the picture below
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bc5983c-afd3-4e8a-a05c-030d70fb477a)

Then you would just need to navigate to it like I showed before in JupyterLab
